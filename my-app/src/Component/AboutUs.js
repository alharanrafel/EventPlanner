             We have aligned our portfolio of companies under a new master
             brand and assumed the name Royalist. With a global 
             footprint reaching more than 20 countries, 
             we have experienced tremendous growth in recent years, extending 
             the solutions we provide customers to create in-person, 
             virtual and hybrid event experiences.
